# lxi-tools-scripts

This repository is the future home of scripts for lxi-tools for making it
easier to manage various test instruments.

These scripts provide high level script interfaces for instruments without
having to deal with all the nitty gritty details of programming instruments.

If you add a new script, please use the following directory structure:

```
<manufacturer>/<instrument model>
```
